Simple tool that takes a long URL and makes it substantially shorter, ensuring that the target location is preserved after the conversion.

## Motivation

To learn more about Full-Stack web development, via the MERN stack. Furthermore, explore different tools that help document APIs, like OpenAPI/SwaggerUI.

## Features

- **URL Conversion**: convert a long URL into a short URL.
- **Interactive API**: view/try API endpoints listed on the documentation.

- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/)

**React** was used for Front-End Development, along with [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com).\
**Express.js** and **PostgreSQL** were used to implement the RESTful API.\
[SwaggerUI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/) was used for API documentation.
